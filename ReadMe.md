#TPK Creator and Estimator

Select zoom levels, and set the maps extent to see tile counts. If the count isn't more than 100,000 (the ArcGIS Online TPK generation limit), you can click `Estimate Size` to request the size of the TPK.

If you zoom out too far, the tile count could exceed the actual number - the app uses the Map's extent, not the tile layer's max extent, and extrapolates where the former is greater than the latter.
